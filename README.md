# CampJS VI

This is a top level planning repo for CampJS VI to be hosted in Springbrook, QLD from the [20 - 23 November 2015](http://lanyrd.com/2015/campjsnews/save-to-calendar/).

We are __striving__ for an open, transparent planning process for the next event and this is the beginnings of that.  The very first thing to do is to start getting expressions of interest from folks that are interested in helping out for the next event, in very targetted areas that will form something similar to Working Groups.

From an initial brain dump we are considering the following groups:

- [Talks and Workshops](https://github.com/campjs/campjs-vi/issues/1)
- [Diversity](https://github.com/campjs/campjs-vi/issues/2)
- [Social](https://github.com/campjs/campjs-vi/issues/3)
- [Sponsorship and Swag](https://github.com/campjs/campjs-vi/issues/4)
- [Logistics](https://github.com/campjs/campjs-vi/issues/5)

Expressions of interest should be voiced in each of the issues that are linked above. It should also be said there is a lot of cross-over between each of the areas and I will be doing my best to help all areas are talking to each other.  In time each of these areas may well have their own repo (or possibly section of this repo - whichever ensures people are in the loop).

Also, feel free to create an issue to discuss anything.
