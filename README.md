# CampJS VI Site

## How to build

```
git clone git@github.com:campjs/campjs-vi.git
git checkout gh-pages
make
```

Then view the site with something like [`st`](https://github.com/isaacs/st) (or your favourite static site server):

```
st -nc -p 8090 -i index.html
```

## Editing Pages

Look in the `src/` directory for an appropriately titled `.jade` file and go from there.  The session data is downloaded and synchronized from [lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2015/campjsnews/) so the best place to ensure session information is up to date is there.

## Sponsor Logos
