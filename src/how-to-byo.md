# CampJS VI and BYO

This time around CampJS will be a BYO affair.  We know that usually you'd arrive at CampJS and be greeted by a fridge full of beer, cider and wine, and that picking up your own on the way is a bit of a hassle. So we've done what we can to make this a bit easier.

## Ordering Online

The 2pm bus from the Airport will be making a stop at both [Varsity Lakes train station](http://jp.translink.com.au/travel-information/network-information/stops-and-stations/stop/varsity-lakes-station) and also [Dan Murphy's at Robina](https://www.danmurphys.com.au/Stores/QLD-Robina-2997).  To make the alcohol pickup stop as quick as possible, we'd encourage everyone to consider using Dan Murhpy's [click & collect service](https://www.danmurphys.com.au/help/click-and-collect-content).  Additionally, if you are unable to pick this alcohol up yourself, we've arranged the super responsible and ever trustworthy [Tim Lucas](https://twitter.com/toolmantim) to be a contact on that bus who can pick up your alcohol for you.

Simply provide the following details in the details of the person collecting the order:

```
First name: Tim
Last name: Lucas
Mobile Number: 0428 906 980
```

Just before you pay for your order the ordering screen should look something like this (if you are picking it up yourself, then put your own name and contact number in):

That's pretty much it.

### But how will I keep track of my stuff?

Ah yes, that old chestnut.  Well, we have about 3000 labels printed ready to go that you can label your beverage with which should definitely help.  Also, feel free to bring along an esky or something to keep your own personal stash cool (we'll make sure we have ice).

And remember, we'll have plenty of non-alcohol beverages available to share, so feel free just to leave the alcohol at home for the weekend.  We're pretty sure you'll still have an awesome time!
